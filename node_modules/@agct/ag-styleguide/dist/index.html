          Before you get started on any digital project, we want to let you know a few things about Allan Gray’s visual language.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Allan Gray Styleguide is a set of living guidelines that communicates a brand promise through our products’ experiences. Our goal is to design for experiences that work together, work the same and work for our users.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Allan Gray we create many different kinds of products, so the guidelines are designed to be more instructive than prescriptive. This effort is relatively new and intentionally crafted to evolve through feedback from product teams and users.

        <h5>AUTHENTIC DESIGNS</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="cell cell--6-col-small">
        <p>
          In everything we do, we put our <strong>users first</strong>. We include them in our prototyping process with thorough user-testing that gives us valuable insight before we start thinking about high fidelity mockups. When using the Allan Gray Styleguide, we ask you to keep the end-user in mind, at all times.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe in authentic design. Authenticity is based on real, shared experiences and is sensed rather than rationalized. Thoughtfulness is a quality that comes from the heart with the best of intentions in mind. It is the deliberate consideration for the needs of others and an empathic understanding of what is most important.
        </p>

        <p>
          To provide authentically thoughtful experiences, we must be more than user-centered, we must be human-centered — to know people first as people, not as users or customers or clients. Our designs are conceived from a deep understanding of humanity and with the desire to help individuals accomplish their goals.

        <h5>KEY PRINCIPLES</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="cell cell--6-col-small">
        <p>
          Visual design communicates messages and solves problems in emotionally compelling ways. It reinforces the meaning of content and helps users make connections.
        </p>

        <div class="semibold">Defer to content</div>
        <p>
          Users care deeply about their content. Give the content center stage in your layout. Design for experiences that are unobtrusive and reduce distraction to lend focus to the work at hand.
        </p>

        <div class="semibold">Clarify complexity</div>
        <p>
          Clarity enhances understanding by helping distinguish between elements. Often we strive for simplicity, but many of our solutions are complex. Design for clear and straightforward interactions to instill a feeling of confidence and ease. Our users should always know what to do and how to do it.
        </p>

        <div class="semibold">Make it useful and beautiful</div>
        <p>
          Utility satisfies needs, but beauty drives desire. Don’t simply make something that works. Design for experiences that people love to have repeatedly. Create aesthetically pleasing offerings that carry a consistent meaning in their form and function.
